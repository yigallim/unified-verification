## Features

This project showcases a complete user journey through two distinct demos, toggled at the top of the screen:

1.  **UVS Identity App:** A mobile-first onboarding flow where an MSME owner creates their secure, verified digital identity by uploading their documents.
2.  **Partner Demo (Maybank):** A simulation of a partner's website, showing how a user can instantly apply for a service (like FPX) with a single click using their UVS Passport, eliminating the need for repetitive form-filling.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started: Running the UI Locally

To run this project on your machine, follow these steps.

1.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd uvs-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install all the necessary dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open your browser:** The application will be running live at `http://localhost:5173`. Any changes you make to the code will update the page automatically.

## ðŸ”Œ Integration Guide for the OCR

Your goal is to replace the simulated data in the frontend with live data from your OCR and identity services. Hereâ€™s exactly how our parts connect.

### There are TWO key integration points:

---

### Integration Point #1: The Initial Document Upload

This is where the user submits their documents, and your OCR service needs to process them and return a verified passport.

*   **File to Modify:** `src/components/UploadForm.jsx`
*   **Function to Focus On:** `handleSubmit`

Inside the `handleSubmit` function, you will see a block labeled `--- SIMULATED BACKEND CALL ---`.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Delete** or **comment out** the entire `setTimeout` block.
2.  **Uncomment** the block below it, labeled `--- REAL AXIOS CALL ---`.
3.  **Update the Endpoint:** Change the URL `'http://localhost:3001/upload'` to match the real endpoint of your backend server.

**Expected API Response Structure:**

When our frontend sends the files to your `/upload` endpoint, it expects a JSON response back. For the UI to work correctly, the structure of this JSON object **must** match the following format:

```json
{
  "uid": "u-1022",
  "name": "Azlan Bin Ahmad",
  "dob": "1990-01-01",
  "license_no": "D12345678",
  "business": {
    "name": "Azlan's Warung",
    "reg_no": "SSM2020-123456"
  },
  "status": "verified",
  "passport": {
    "age_verified": true,
    "business_verified": true,
    "photo_verified": false
  }
}```

This JSON object is then passed to the `DigitalPassport.jsx` component to display the results.

---

### Integration Point #2: The "Apply with UVS" Magic

This is where a partner (Maybank) fetches the user's verified data after they consent.

*   **File to Modify:** `src/components/PartnerDemo.jsx`

At the top of this file, you will see a constant variable named `uvsVerifiedData`. This is the hardcoded data that currently populates the Maybank form.

**Your Task:**
In a real-world scenario, the `handleApplyWithUVS` function would make an API call to your backend. Your backend would then fetch the user's data (using their UID from a login session), decrypt it, and send it back to the frontend.

For the hackathon, you need to replace the hardcoded `uvsVerifiedData` constant with data fetched from your service.

**Expected Data Structure:**

When the frontend asks for the user's data to auto-fill the form, the JSON object returned from your service **must** have this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Azlan Bin Ahmad",
  "business": {
    "name": "Azlan's Warung",
    "reg_no": "SSM2020-123456",
    "address": "123 Jalan Niaga, 50450 Kuala Lumpur",
    "type": "Sole Proprietorship",
    "branch": "KL Main Branch"
  },
  "dob": "1990-01-01"
}
